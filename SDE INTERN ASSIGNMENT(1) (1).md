## **Assignment Details**

## **Title: Live Polling System**

### 

### 

### **Design Reference**

* **Design Link:** [https://www.figma.com/design/uhinheFgWssbxvlI7wtf59/Intervue-Assigment--Poll-system?node-id=0-1\&t=Y5](https://www.figma.com/design/uhinheFgWssbxvlI7wtf59/Intervue-Assigment--Poll-system?node-id=0-1&t=Y5GfjIgQte8VUTgA-1)  
* **Design Preview:** *(Insert design image screenshot here — ideally from the Figma file for quick reference)*

You are required to create a **"Resilient Live Polling System"** with two personas: **Teacher** and **Student**.

Unlike a basic todo-list app, this system must handle state recovery. If a teacher refreshes their browser mid-poll, the poll should not disappear. If a student joins 30 seconds late to a 60-second question, their timer must start at 30 seconds, not 60\.

---

### **Technology Stack**

* **Frontend:** React.js (Hooks required; Redux/Context API optional but preferred).  
* **Backend:** Node.js with Express.  
* **Real-time Communication:** Socket.io.  
* **Database:** MongoDB or PostgreSQL (Required for persistence).  
* **Languages:** TypeScript

---

### **Functional Requirements**

1. #### **Teacher Persona (Admin)**

* **Poll Creation:** Ability to create a question with options and a timer duration (e.g., 60 seconds).  
* **Live Dashboard:** View real-time updates as students submit votes (e.g., "Option A: 40%, Option B: 60%").  
* **Poll History (DB Integration):** View a list of previously conducted polls and their final aggregate results, fetched from the database.  
* Create a new poll  
* View live polling results  
* Ask a new question only if:

  * No question has been asked yet, **or**  
  * All students have answered the previous question

2. #### **Student Persona (User)**

* **Onboarding:** Enter a name on the first visit (unique per session/tab).  
* **Real-time Interaction:** Receive the question instantly when the teacher asks it.  
* **Timer Synchronization:** The timer must remain in sync with the server.  
  * *Scenario:* If the time limit is 60s and a student joins 10 seconds late, their timer must show **50s**, not 60s.  
* **Voting:** Submit an answer within the time limit.  
* Enter name on first visit (unique to each tab)  
* Submit answers once a question is asked  
* View live polling results after submission  
* Maximum of 60 seconds to answer a question, after which results are shown

3. #### **System Behavior (The "Resilience" Factor)**

* **State Recovery:** If the Teacher or Student refreshes the page during an active poll, the application must fetch the current state from the backend and resume the UI exactly where it left off.  
* **Race Conditions:** Ensure that a student cannot vote more than once per question, even if they spam the API or manipulate the client-side code.

### **Code Quality & Architecture Standards**

We place a high value on clean, maintainable code. Your submission will be evaluated on the following strict criteria:

1. **Backend Architecture (Separation of Concerns)**  
* Do not write business logic directly inside Socket listeners or Express routes.  
* Use a **Controller-Service** pattern.  
  * *Example:* PollSocketHandler.js handles the connection, while PollService.js handles the logic and DB interaction.

2. **Frontend Architecture**  
* Use **Custom Hooks** (e.g., useSocket, usePollTimer) to separate logic from UI components.  
* Implement **Optimistic UI** updates where appropriate (UI updates immediately, reverts on error).

3. **Error Handling**  
* The app should not crash if the database is temporarily unreachable.  
* Provide user feedback (toasts/alerts) for connection errors or submission failures.

4.  **Data Integrity**  
* Use the Database to persist Polls, Options, and Votes.  
* Ensure the server is the "Source of Truth" for the timer and vote counts.

## **Must-Have Requirements**

* Functional system with all core features working  
* Hosting for both frontend and backend  
* Teacher can create polls and students can answer them  
* Both teacher and student can view poll results  
* **Please ensure the UI in your assignment submission follows the shared Figma design without any deviations.**

## **Good to Have**

* Configurable poll time limit by teacher  
* Option for teacher to remove a student  
* Well-designed user interface  
* System behavior **(The "Resilience" Factor)**

## **Bonus Features (Brownie Points)**

* Chat popup for interaction between students and teachers  
* Teacher can view past poll results (not stored locally)
